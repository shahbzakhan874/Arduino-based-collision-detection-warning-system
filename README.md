# Arduino-based-collision-detection-warning-system
This is arduino based collision detection warning system. This kind of system is fastest groing safety feature in automotive industries. Such system enabbles vehicles to identify thechances of collision and give visula and audio warning to driver. So that driver can take necessary action to avoid collision. This project idea is based on arduino controller and the whole system will give you very good understanding that how this system works. The step by step method is explained so that you can make this system. The hardware coneection, pin information and arduino program is explained clearly.
